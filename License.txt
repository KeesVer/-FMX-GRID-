------------------
II. License grant
------------------

II.a. Developer license

Licensor hereby grants to Licensee, and Licensee hereby accepts, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, a non-exclusive license to
use A-Dato Scheduler Component Suite as set forth in this Agreement. The term "license"
as used in this Agreement shall mean and include:

include the right and/or permits licensee in any way to redistribute
software which includes in any form (in source code, binary form or else)
(parts of) licensor's software, i.e. A-Dato Scheduler Components.
Redistribution of Redistributable Software requires the purchase of additional
license(s) from licensor. Licensee will therefore contact licensor whenever a
copy of the Licensee's Application Program is sold, delivered or released to a
customer or any other 3rd party.

--------------
III. Transfer
--------------

individual. The A-Dato Scheduler Component Suite may be transferred together

to Licensor.

When the A-Dato Scheduler Component Suite and License Agreement are
transferred, all copies, upgrades, prior versions, and documentation must be
either transferred or destroyed. Transferring the A-Dato Scheduler Component
Suite terminates this License Agreement with the original Licensee.

-----------------
IV. Restrictions
-----------------

In accepting the license granted by Licensor, Licensee agrees that it shall
not
  * Include the Redistributable Software with a product which is itself a
    software development kit, software component, or software library;
  * Permit its end-users to redistribute the Redistributable Software;
  * Loan or rent A-Dato Scheduler Component Suite to a third party;
  * Attempt to disassemble or reverse-engineer software included with the
    A-Dato Scheduler Component Suite;

unless terminated as provided below.

-----------------------------

-----------------------------

The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all
copies of A-Dato Scheduler Component Suite. In the event of a material
default by the Licensee or the Licensee's agent or representative, of any
provision of this Agreement, the Licensor may terminate this Agreement upon
thirty (30) days written notice, except that the Licensee shall have
thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of termination. Upon termination of the
Agreement, the Licensee shall either destroy all licensed copies of A-Dato
Scheduler Component Suite, and all backups, or return them to Licensor. This
obligation shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

-------------------------------------------
VII. Software Assurance License
-------------------------------------------

Each purchase includes a software assurance license (SA) for the duration mentioned.
This license assures access to all new A-Dato Scheduler releases (both updates and upgrades)
during the SA license period. When the Licensee's SA license expires, the Licensee will
continue to have access to all versions released before the expiration date. However,
newer versions will no longer be available. New SA licenses can be purchased from the
